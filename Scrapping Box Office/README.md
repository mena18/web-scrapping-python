getting all the movies in the last 5 years (2016-2020) from the website and save them in a csv file with a *youtube trailer* and a watched field to be marked as 0

you can get suggested movies which will get you top n movies name and trailer based on the "Worldwide"  excluding the movies you watched (you can mark them manually in the csv by making watched = 1)
